export const aboutText = `I always loved videogames, paired with my growing curiosity for technologies I naturally gravitated towards developing my own. This led me to find my passion for coding early on and when I was presented with the opportunity to study Software Engineering in the United States I took it. There I fell in love with the Software Development Life Cycle as well as refining soft-skills greatly thanks to a part-time job I had at the campus tech center. After graduation, as a Software Engineer, I had the privilege of working alongside talented mentors, learning to design large-scale systems and deliver production-ready applications. These experiences not only deepened my technical expertise but also fueled my drive to keep growing and contributing to impactful software solutions.`
