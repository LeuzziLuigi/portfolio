export const aboutText = [`Starting as a game developer hobbyist, I discovered my passion for coding early on and decided to pursue it professionally. I had the opportunity to study Software Engineering in the US, where I fell in love with the Software Development Life Cycle. Since then, I have grown into a versatile Software Engineer contributing to projects across energy, sustainability, banking, and low-code platforms.`, `Through these experiences, I have designed large-scale systems, implemented performance optimizations, and delivered production-ready applications in both enterprise and startup environments. Collaborating with mentors, product teams, and business stakeholders has strengthened not only my technical skills but also my ability to communicate effectively and translate requirements into impactful solutions.`, `I am driven by curiosity, and I care deeply about user experience and scalability.`];
